<h1>Radar Earth Tutorial Guide</h1>

Weight: 4
As a user of the weather app, when I go to website
a pop up should overlay on top of the app. This pop
up should be a tutorial, that explains to me how to
use the application. It will teach me how to search 
locations, add/del locations from my fav's list.
At the bottom, there could be an option to close 
the tutorial and also an option to "never see again"
so that pop up will not reoccur.
